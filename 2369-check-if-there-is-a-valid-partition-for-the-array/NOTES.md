How did I get to know that we need to use DP?
â€‹
* According to the problem there are "3 possibilities", that are: 1) two continuous elements should be equal, 2) three continuous elements should be equal, 3) three elements should be consecutively increasing
* So, whenever we have "possibilities" we use recursion.
* After using recursion, it was throwing TLE, and to optimize it, I used DP.
